# LeetCode Solutions

A structured collection of my **LeetCode problem solutions,** each with a clean explanation, accepted submission details, and downloadable problem PDFs.

This repository is designed to showcase clear reasoning, efficient data structures, and production-quality code.

---

## Each problem folder includes:
- **solution.py** – Full implementation
- **explanation.md** – Step-by-step reasoning and code design
- **README.md** – Summary for that specific problem
- **LeetCode PDFs** – Problem statement and submission confirmation

---

## Goals
- Write **clean, readable, and efficient** solutions  
- Document each problem’s **thought process and algorithm design**  
- Build a **long-term reference** for learning, interviews, and open-source sharing

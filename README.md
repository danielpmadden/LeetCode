# LeetCode Solutions (AI-Assisted, Human-Verified & Ontologically Structured)

A curated collection of **AI-assisted algorithmic problem solutions**, each **human-reviewed, verified, and documented** for correctness, efficiency, and reasoning clarity.  

This repository demonstrates **transparent problem-solving**, **structured documentation**, and a **governed approach to AI-augmented development** — blending automation with disciplined human oversight and **ontological organization**.

---

## Purpose

This project serves as both a **portfolio** and a **learning ontology** — a structured, evolving map of algorithmic reasoning.  
It shows how **AI tools and human engineers can collaborate responsibly**, producing explainable, reproducible, and efficient code while maintaining **semantic consistency and conceptual traceability**.  

Each entry functions as a *node in a reasoning ontology*:  
a documented instance of how a specific problem type, data structure, or design pattern is understood, solved, and explained.

---

## Repository Structure

Each problem folder includes:

- **`solution.py`** – AI-assisted implementation, edited and verified for accuracy and performance  
- **`explanation.md`** – Step-by-step reasoning, algorithm design, and complexity analysis  
- **`README.md`** – Concise summary for quick browsing  
- **`LeetCode PDFs`** – Original problem statement and accepted-submission proof  

Organized by:
- **Problem number & title**
- **Programming language**
- **Ontological tags** (problem type, algorithmic category, data structure)

---

## Methodology: Responsible AI Collaboration

This repository applies a **human-in-the-loop** governance model for AI-assisted development:

1. **Prompting & Drafting:** AI models propose initial solutions and narrative explanations.  
2. **Verification:** Outputs are manually reviewed, tested, and benchmarked against LeetCode cases.  
3. **Documentation:** Reasoning is rewritten for precision, with ontology tags added for conceptual traceability.  
4. **Governance:** Metadata and PDFs preserve proof of correctness and performance transparency.  

This workflow reflects a commitment to **responsible AI usage**, **explainability**, and **knowledge integrity**.

---

## Objectives

- Write **clean, readable, and optimized** solutions across diverse algorithmic domains  
- Document **reasoning structures** and **design intent** for each solution  
- Maintain an **auditable record of AI collaboration** through human verification  
- Build an **ontological framework** for algorithmic understanding — connecting problems, patterns, and reasoning strategies  
- Contribute to a **transparent, explainable culture** of AI-assisted engineering

## Ontological Taxonomy (WIP)

Each solution will eventually reference one or more ontology layers:

1. **Conceptual** Abstract problem category (e.g., sorting, recursion, graph traversal) |
2. **Structural** Core data structure or pattern (e.g., tree, hash map, dynamic table) |
3. **Procedural** Algorithmic design pattern (e.g., divide & conquer, greedy, backtracking) |
4. **Epistemic** Type of reasoning used (e.g., inductive, deductive, heuristic) |

This taxonomy evolves as the repository grows — forming a **knowledge graph of algorithmic reasoning**.

---

## Topics Covered

- Arrays & Strings  
- Linked Lists  
- Trees & Graphs  
- Dynamic Programming  
- Recursion & Backtracking  
- Greedy Algorithms  
- Search & Optimization  
- Design Patterns  

*(Continuously expanding and cross-linked via ontology tags.)*

## Philosophy

> “Automation should not replace reasoning — it should illuminate it.”

This repository treats code as a **semantic artifact** — not just an executable sequence, but a **statement in an ontology of reasoning**.  
Each problem is an opportunity to clarify how humans and machines *co-produce understanding*.

---

## Future Roadmap

- [ ] Add **multi-language solutions** (Python, JavaScript, C++)  
- [ ] Introduce **runtime benchmarking** and **complexity graphs**  
- [ ] Build an **ontology.json** knowledge schema for problem-type relationships  
- [ ] Develop a **visual reasoning map** linking related algorithms  
- [ ] Publish an **AI collaboration log** showing model contributions and human edits  

---

## Contributing

This repository is a personal experiment in **AI governance, transparency, and reasoning ontology**, but contributions and insights are welcome — especially regarding:

- Ontological modeling of algorithms  
- Alternative reasoning pathways  
- Comparative complexity analysis  
- Governance best practices for AI-assisted code  

Feel free to open issues, discussions, or pull requests with references or examples.

## In Short

This is more than a collection of solutions —  
it’s an **experiment in structured reasoning, governance, and ontological clarity**.  

> *Where human oversight meets machine reasoning — documented, verified, and semantically mapped.*
